# Assignments

Course assignments for Algorithms Design & Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

This repository contains selected course assignments completed during my undergraduate studies in Computer and Communications Engineering.  
The assignments focus on practical problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and applying theoretical concepts through implementation.

## Contents

### Algorithms Design and Analysis
This section includes assignments related to core algorithmic concepts such as:
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees and Graphs
- Hashing and Sorting
- Complexity analysis and optimization

Through these assignments, I developed the ability to:
- Break down complex problems into smaller subproblems, becoming proficient in solving common to medium-level brute-force and recursive problems
- Choose appropriate data structures to improve efficiency
- Analyze time and space complexity
- Translate theoretical algorithms into working code, such as Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Dijkstra’s algorithm

### Machine Intelligence
This section contains assignments related to introductory machine intelligence topics, including:
- Search algorithms
- Heuristics
- Reinforcement learning concepts
- Problem modeling and evaluation
- Basic decision-making algorithms

Through these assignments, I gained experience in:
- Modeling problems mathematically and computationally
- Implementing learning-based and search-based solutions
- Understanding the trade-offs between different intelligent approaches

## Notes
- These assignments were completed as part of coursework and are intended to demonstrate learning and problem-solving skills.
- Code quality reflects a learning process and progressive improvement over time.
