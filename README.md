# Assignments-
Course assignments for Algorithms Design & Analysis and Machine Intelligence.


This repository contains selected course assignments completed during my undergraduate studies in Computer and Communications Engineering.
The assignments focus on practical problem solving, algorithmic thinking, and applying theoretical concepts through implementation.

## Contents

### Algorithms Design and Analysis
This section includes assignments related to core algorithmic concepts such as:
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees and Graphs
- Hashing and Sorting
- Complexity analysis and optimization

Through these assignments, I learned how to:
- Break down complex problems into smaller subproblems (therefore, I became well versed and skilled in handling common as well as medium to advanced brute force problems and recursive approcach to solutions) 
- Choose appropriate data structures for efficiency
- Analyze time and space complexity
- Translate theoretical algorithms into working code ( example : quick, heap, selecting, inserting and bubble sort, Dijexstra, etc)

### Machine Intelligence
This section contains assignments related to introductory machine intelligence topics, including:
- Search algorithms
- Heuristics 
- Reinforcement learning concepts
- Problem modeling and evaluation
- Basic decision-making algorithms

Through these assignments, I gained experience in:
- Modeling problems mathematically and computationally
- Implementing learning and search-based solutions
- Understanding the trade-offs between different intelligent approaches

## Notes
- These assignments were completed as part of coursework and are intended to demonstrate learning and problem-solving skills.
- Code quality reflects a learning process and progressive improvement over time.
